## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lavish-tender-scrape.git
cd lavish-tender-scrape
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you're planning to scrape dynamic or CAPTCHA-protected pages, install Selenium:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

Download the appropriate [WebDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) for your browser and place it in your PATH.

### 3. Run the Scraper

```bash
python main.py
```

This will initiate scraping for all configured sources and output the results in your `/output` folder.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Inside `main.py` or a custom config file (coming soon), you can:

* Select sites to scrape
* Choose output format (CSV, JSON, SQLite)
* Schedule scraping intervals (manual for now)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Each scraper inherits from the `BaseScraper` class and must implement:

```python
class MyScraper(BaseScraper):
    def fetch(self):
        # Fetch HTML or render page
        return html

    def parse(self, html):
        # Extract tenders
        return tenders_list
```

The `main.py` script coordinates all scrapers, formats the results, and saves them to the desired format.

---

## 🔐 CAPTCHA Handling (Optional)

If a site uses CAPTCHA, use the Selenium-based implementation:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://example.com")
```

For more advanced CAPTCHAs, integrate with services like:

* [2Captcha](https://2captcha.com/)
* [Anti-Captcha](https://anti-captcha.com/)
